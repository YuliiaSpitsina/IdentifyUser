The purpose of the work is to develop and analyze software designed to identify users based on their keyboard handwriting. 
The main attention is paid to the use of statistical methods for data processing, which ensure high accuracy and reliability of authentication.

The program analyzes the time of pressing and releasing the keys, intervals between presses and other characteristics of keyboard input. 
As a result of the analysis, a unique keyboard handwriting profile is formed for each user.

The project "User identification by keyboard handwriting" is a solution in the field of security and personalization of computer systems. 
The main goal of the project is the development of software capable of accurately identifying a person based on the analysis of his manner of typing on the keyboard. 
This approach to identification opens up new opportunities in ensuring data security and confidentiality.
Key features of the project:
- Analysis of Keyboard Input: The program uses algorithms to measure the time between key presses, the duration of presses and the general dynamics of typing.
- Creation of Unique User Profiles: Based on the results of the analysis, individual keyboard input profiles are formed, reflecting the unique features of each user.
- Security and privacy: Using keyboard handwriting (KP) as an authentication method provides a higher level of security, as this method is difficult to forge or copy.
- Modularity and Integration: The program is designed in such a way that it can be easily integrated with existing security systems and software.
- Intuitive Interface: A simple and clear user interface that allows you to easily manage settings and view statistics.
