Vivid dreams often reflect hidden desires, revealing secrets.
Majestic mountains rise for a long time, guarding a quiet, dark, whispering forest.
The work should demonstrate the ability to use theoretical knowledge.
Stars shine with hope in the night, guiding travelers along the roads of dreams.
Forest paths invite you to a journey where every step leads to the secrets of nature.
